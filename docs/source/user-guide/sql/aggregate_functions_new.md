# Aggregate Functions (NEW)

This page is a WIP and will replace the Aggregate Functions page once completed.

Aggregate functions operate on a set of values to compute a single result.

## General Functions

- [bit_and](#bit_and)
- [bit_or](#bit_or)
- [bit_xor](#bit_xor)

### `bit_and`

Computes the bitwise AND of all non-null input values.

```
bit_and(expression)
```

#### Arguments

- **expression**: Expression to operate on. Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of arithmetic operators.

### `bit_or`

Computes the bitwise OR of all non-null input values.

```
bit_or(expression)
```

#### Arguments

- **expression**: Expression to operate on. Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of arithmetic operators.

### `bit_xor`

Computes the bitwise exclusive OR of all non-null input values.

```
bit_xor(expression)
```

#### Arguments

- **expression**: Expression to operate on. Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of arithmetic operators.
